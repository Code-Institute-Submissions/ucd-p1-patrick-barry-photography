# Patrick Barry Photography

Patrick Barry Photography is an established photography business in Munster. Their main business is wedding photography but in the off season they also photograph on location and interiors B2B. They also enjoy landscape and food photography.

Patrick Barry Photography require a “less is more” online presence.

The goal of which is to -

##### 1 - Generate business leads -
* They would prefer to gather contact details from their website rather than potential customers phoning them, because they are often unable to answer the phone.

##### 2 - Display their best work -
* They would like a neat easy to use area of their site to display a small amount of their best work to wow potential customers.
* This should be user friendly and responsive because sometimes they direct potential clients to their mobile devices when they meet them on location.

##### 3 - Generate a positive emotional response -
* They would like users/visitors of their site to feel good about PBP as a potential choice of photographer.
* They want to make use of their client testimonials (real people, real results) to assure other potential clients of their past successes and their likability factor.
* The photo content should be WOW as opposed to overkill (too much).
* The experience should be easily navigable with minimal effort/clicks to contact.

## UX

The project needs to be clean and minimal in design to reflect the style of photography favoured by the client and most sought after by his clients in turn.

#### User Stories

* As someone looking for a wedding photographer,<br>
Ann Walsh from Bandon wants to find a photographer that<br>
stands out from the crowd among the hundreds that she sees online.<br>
<b>Achieved by striking colour scheme and large logo in header</b>

* As a amateur photographer,<br>
John Allen wants to quickly see what a photographer deems their<br>
best work up front and centre on a photography website homepage.<br>
<b>Achieved by photography categories being identified by an image</b>

* As someone looking for a photographer, and not very trusting by nature,<br>
Mary from Waterford wants to see genuine client testimonials<br>
which reassure her before committing.<br>
<b>Achieved by client testimonials appearing below relevant photography category</b>

* As someone who hates all the pinks/purples of most sites that target the wedding industry,<br>
Kate is always more inclined to stay on a site that is<br>
beautifully minimal and well designed than one that is “pretty in pink”<br>
and full of endless services/offers.<br>
<b>Achieved by neutral colour scheme appealing to both men and women, and by less frills overall</b>

#### Design Considerations

Some thoughts as a designer beginning this project.

#### Site Navigation

Considering the minimalistic requirement of the client, very few pages are used and the navigation is clean.

#### Wireframe Mockups

See document linked in below showing mobile first approach how the site should appear firstly on smaller mobiles, through to tablet, then desktop.
Some divs will utilise Bootstrap hidden class to disappear on mobile so page content is not too large (tall).

## Features

In keeping with the clients desires, this website is not heavy on features, but works perfectly thus creating a positive emotional response for the user.
 
- Logo - New unique logo created for the client.
- Menu - Neat small menu, collapsing to a centred hamburger style menu on mobiles.
- Grow on Hover - Small animation on hovered images.
- Testimonials - Prominent on homepage.
- Call to Action - Wanna Book is a constant throughout the site, and becomes sticky (to bottom) on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
